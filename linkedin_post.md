🚀 **Coding for a Greener Future: Sustainable Software Engineering** 🌱💻

Did you know that the code we write has a physical carbon footprint?
Every CPU cycle consumes energy. In a world of massive data centers, **Software Efficiency = Climate Action**.

To demonstrate this, I built **"EcoCompute"**: A Python functionality that estimates the $gCO_2eq$ (Grams of Carbon) impact of your computational tasks using Machine Learning.

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
✅ **Hexagonal Architecture**: Decoupling "Green Logic" from the API.
✅ **FastAPI & Docker**: Microservice-ready and containerized.
✅ **ML**: Regression model for Energy Estimation.
✅ **CI/CD**: Automated pipelines on GitHub.

📚 **Education & Opportunity**
This project was inspired by the **Free Postgraduate Degree** (100% EAD) at **IFSP Capivari**!
They are opening 50 spots for "Specialization in Web & Mobile Development". A huge opportunity to level up your engineering skills for free.
